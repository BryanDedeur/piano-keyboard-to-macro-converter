show me a python program that reads input from the terminal and then outputs it to a file?

Certainly! Here is a simple Python program that reads user input from the terminal and then writes it to a file:

```python
def read_input():
    # Read input from the terminal
    user_input = input("Enter your text: ")

    # Open a file to write
    with open("output.txt", mode='w') as file:
        # Write the input to the file
        file.write(user_input)
    
    print("Input written to 'output.txt' successfully!")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    read_input()
```

When you run this program, it prompts you to enter your text in the terminal. After you press enter, it creates a file named `output.txt` and writes your input to it.

You can modify the file name or path according to your preference by changing `"output.txt"` to your desired file name or path.
